# Tonies Capture — Flipper Zero Application

A native Flipper Zero application (`NFC` category) purpose-built for rapidly scanning, unlocking, verifying, and saving **Tonies (`NXP ICODE SLIX-L`)** NFC figures without ever saving a truncated or corrupted `.nfc` file.

---

## Why This App Exists

Tonies figures use **NXP ICODE SLIX-L** (`ISO15693-3`) tags locked in **Privacy Mode** with the standard Toniebox privacy password (`7F FD 6E 5B`).

When scanning a Tonie using the built-in Flipper Zero NFC app (**Extra Actions → Unlock SLIX-L → as TonieBox (TommyBox)**), moving the figure away slightly too early often produces a `.nfc` file that looks valid at a glance—and even has a full 8-byte `E0 04 03 ...` UID—but fails when emulated or inspected:

1. **Silent Partial Block Reads (`00 00 00 00` trailing blocks)**: In the Flipper firmware's ISO15693-3 poller (`iso15693_3_poller_filter_error()`), an RF timeout (`Iso15693_3ErrorTimeout`) while reading data blocks is treated as `Iso15693_3ErrorNone` (end-of-memory), leaving any unread blocks zero-filled (`00 00 00 00`). Since Tonie figures have thick plastic bases and weak coupling, losing RF lock mid-read is common.
2. **Default Privacy Password (`0F 0F 0F 0F`)**: If `slix_poller_get_random_number()` times out during the post-read password check stage, `slix_poller_handler_check_privacy_password()` still transitions to `SlixPollerStateReady` and saves the default placeholder password (`0F 0F 0F 0F`) instead of `7F FD 6E 5B`.
3. **Slow Multi-Menu Workflow**: Capturing a collection of Tonies in the stock NFC app requires navigating through **Extra Actions → Unlock SLIX-L → TonieBox → Save → Name** for every single figure.

**Tonies Capture** solves all three problems by running a continuous, hands-free SLIX-L unlock loop that strictly validates all 8 blocks in memory *and* reads back the saved `.nfc` file from the SD card to verify its integrity before showing a prominent **`SAVED! 8 / 8`** confirmation.

## Features

- **Continuous Hands-Free Batch Scanning**: Hold one Tonie to the back of your Flipper Zero, wait for the **`SAVED! 8 / 8`** banner and green LED + double-beep, and immediately swap to the next Tonie—no menu navigation required between figures.
- **Automatic SLIX-L Privacy Unlock**: Automatically supplies the Toniebox privacy password (`7F FD 6E 5B`) on every `SlixPollerEventTypePrivacyUnlockRequest`.
- **Strict 8/8 Block Verification**:
  - Verifies the 8-byte ISO15693 UID begins with `E0 04 03` (NXP ICODE SLIX-L).
  - Verifies all **8 blocks (32 bytes)** of `Data Content` are present and non-zero (`block_count == 8` and `block_size == 4`).
  - Reads back the newly written `.nfc` file from `/ext/nfc/` on the SD card to confirm `Device type: SLIX-L`, `Password Privacy: 7F FD 6E 5B`, `Privacy Mode: false`, and all 8 non-zero data blocks on disk.
- **Live Block Progress & Partial Read Recovery**: If a Tonie is pulled away mid-read (e.g. `3/8` blocks read), the app displays a visual progress bar showing how many blocks were captured, alerts you with a short vibration, and immediately resets the poller so you can hold the figure steady to finish.
- **UID Deduplication & Automatic Repair**:
  - Before saving, the app checks `/ext/nfc/*.nfc` by 8-byte `UID`.
  - If a **valid** `.nfc` file with that UID already exists on the SD card (even under a custom name like `Zootopia.nfc`), it will **not** create a duplicate file.
  - If an **incomplete/broken** `.nfc` file with that UID is found on the SD card (such as a bad `SLIX-L_*.nfc` capture from the stock NFC app), it automatically deletes the broken file and replaces it with the verified `8/8` capture.
- **Repeat Scan Counter (`Scan #1`, `Scan #2`, …)**: Scanning the same Tonie again performs a full live RF unlock and `8/8` block check, increments the on-screen scan counter (`Scan #2`, `Scan #3`, …), and plays a confirmation chirp without writing duplicate files.
- **One-Button On-Device Rename**: Press **OK (Center)** right after a scan to rename the file on the spot, or leave it auto-named (`Tonie_<last4bytes>.nfc`) and keep scanning.
- **Built-In SD Card Auditor (`Check SD Card`)**: Scans every `.nfc` file in `/ext/nfc/` and reports how many valid vs. incomplete `SLIX-L` files exist on your SD card, listing the exact filename and failure reason (`blk 5=00000000`, `Bad PwdPrivacy`, etc.) for any broken captures.

## Usage

### Main Menu

When you launch **Tonies Capture** (**Apps → NFC → Tonies Capture**), you are presented with two options:

1. **Scan Tonies**: Starts the continuous SLIX-L Tonie scanner.
2. **Check SD Card**: Audits all `.nfc` files in `/ext/nfc/` and displays a report of valid vs. incomplete SLIX-L files.

---

### Scanning Tonies

1. Select **Scan Tonies** from the main menu. The Flipper Zero LED will pulse cyan while waiting for a Tonie.
2. Hold the base of a Tonie figure flat against the back of the Flipper Zero.
3. Keep the figure steady until the double-framed banner appears:
   ```text
   ╔══════════════════════════╗
   ║     SAVED!     8 / 8     ║
   ╚══════════════════════════╝
          Tonie_1EBD0A00
             Scan #1
   ```
4. Once you see **`SAVED! 8 / 8`** (accompanied by a green LED flash and two confirmation beeps):
   - **Hold the next Tonie** to the back of the Flipper to immediately capture another figure.
   - **Hold the same Tonie again** to re-verify its RF read (`Scan #2`, `Scan #3`, …) without writing a new file.
   - **Press `OK` (Center)** if you want to rename the `.nfc` file right away.
   - **Press `Back`** to return to the main menu.

---

### Auditing Existing `.nfc` Files (`Check SD Card`)

Select **Check SD Card** from the main menu to inspect `/ext/nfc`:
- Every `.nfc` file with `Device type: SLIX-L` is checked against the strict Tonie completeness rules.
- If all files are healthy, it reports `All SLIX-L files on SD are complete!`.
- If any incomplete captures are found, each file and its specific defect (e.g., `SLIX-L_22A9427F.nfc: blk 5=00000000`) are listed. Simply scan the affected physical Tonie in **Scan Tonies** mode to automatically replace the broken file with a verified `8/8` capture.

## Anatomy of a Valid Tonie `.nfc` File

Every `.nfc` file saved or verified by **Tonies Capture** adheres to the following structure:

```ini
Filetype: Flipper NFC device
Version: 4
# Device type can be ISO15693-3, SLIX, SLIX-S, SLIX-L or SLIX2
Device type: SLIX-L
# UID is common for all formats
UID: E0 04 03 50 XX XX XX XX
# ISO15693-3 specific data
DSFID: 00
AFI: 00
IC Reference: 03
Lock DSFID: false
Lock AFI: false
# Memory content
Block Count: 8
Block Size: 4
Data Content: XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX
Security Status: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
# SLIX specific data
Capabilities: Default
Password Privacy: 7F FD 6E 5B
Password Destroy: 0F 0F 0F 0F
Password EAS/AFI: 0F 0F 0F 0F
Privacy Mode: false
Lock EAS: false
Lock PPL: false
```

### Verification Criteria

| Field | Required Value | Failure Symptom in Stock NFC App |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Device type` | `SLIX-L` | Saved as generic `ISO15693-3` if SLIX poller fails |
| `UID` | `E0 04 03 ...` (8 bytes) | Missing or wrong IC manufacturer/type |
| `Block Count` / `Block Size` | `8` blocks × `4` bytes (`32` bytes total) | Truncated block count |
| `Data Content` | All 8 blocks (`4` bytes each) non-zero | Trailing `00 00 00 00` blocks when RF drops mid-read |
| `Password Privacy` | `7F FD 6E 5B` | Left at default `0F 0F 0F 0F` on random-number timeout |
| `Privacy Mode` | `false` | Left `true` if privacy unlock was not completed |
